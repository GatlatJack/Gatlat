                <p>
                    Today marks a special day in my life - not just because I'm sharing this reflection, but because it represents a new beginning. As a resettled person in Canada, I'm finally living like everyone else after being a refugee for most of my childhood. I now feel I am a person like the rest - not that I didn't before, because I always believed I wouldn't drown. But this feels different. This feels like home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sitting here at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, I often find myself thinking back to that 11-year-old boy in the back of a pickup truck, watching a red-brown sunset as we approached Kakuma Refugee Camp. My heart was so heavy that day - too heavy for a child. I had just said goodbye to my spiritual father and pastor, Pastor Martin. My country was engulfed in flames due to civil war, and I didn't know where my mother was. I was the eldest of my two sisters, the only siblings I was with at that time.
                </p>

                <div class="blog-image-section">
                    <img src="../assets/story1.png" alt="Early Journey" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block; border-radius: 12px;">
                </div>

                <p>
                    That evening, I wept bitterly in so much pain, and I told the Lord: "Wherever I shall be, God let me find you." It was a prayer that would carry me through the years ahead, though I couldn't have imagined then where this journey would lead.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Wherever I shall be, God let me find you." - My prayer as an 11-year-old boy entering Kakuma Refugee Camp
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Angels in Human Form</h2>
                <p>
                    What I discovered in Kakuma was something beautiful - the power of human love that transcends borders, tribes, and blood ties. Thanks to Eunice Mosonik and Joseph Oluyundi, two Kenyan angels, I was admitted to Ngundeng Primary School. These extraordinary people never saw me as different, despite having no blood ties or tribal affiliations with me - they simply loved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eunice took me in as her foster child since my mother was not around. She treated me like one of her own children, buying me books and clothes, feeding me with love. She even took me to her village to meet her family, her husband, and in-laws. I was literally like her son. Later, when she moved to Nairobi and worked as a driver at UNICEF in Gigiri, she continued to care for me from afar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I joined high school, instead of returning to the camp when bus fare was unaffordable, Joseph opened his home to me. He would take me to the bus stop and ensure I reached school safely. My blood uncle also cared for me throughout this journey. These small acts of love became the foundation that held my world together.
                </p>

                <h2>Building Character Through Service</h2>
                <p>
                    I had no uniform when I started school. Thankfully, I found an old, used one in the corner of the church while I was sweeping - cleaning had become both a part of me and a habit of mine. My daily routine began at 5 AM as I walked to school, returning in the evening to attend fellowship in church and water the trees in the church compound. I would use a wheelbarrow to fetch 4 to 5 twenty-liter containers of water.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through fellowshipping together with Joseph and Eunice in church, I discovered something unexpected - I could play the piano. It became something beautiful for me, and I started playing it during Sunday services as part of the choir. Music became another source of joy and purpose in my life, connecting me even deeper to the church community that had embraced me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These small acts of service became the foundation of my character. Looking back now, I see how those early morning chores, those church duties, that discipline of service was preparing me for something greater than I could have imagined.
                </p>

                <h2>Education as Liberation</h2>
                <p>
                    Four years later, I took my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams and earned a scholarship from Windle Trust, Kenya (which later became Windle International Kenya) after scoring 408 out of a possible 500 marks. I ranked as the second-best student in mathematics in the entire country. Education was becoming my pathway to something beyond the camp.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I joined Butula Boys High School and excelled, but then life threw me another curveball. I discovered I had an epididymal cyst and had to leave school early in 2020 for surgery. In the camp, surgeons only visit at specific times of the year, creating a lengthy cycle of uncertainty for those needing medical care.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I fell behind in my studies and struggled through Form Three. Although I had been a promising A-grade student, there simply wasn't enough time to catch up. Then COVID-19 struck, and we were kept out of school for an extended period. As part of the KCSE 2022 cohort, we had to complete 4 terms in one year - the third term of Form 3 and all 3 terms of Form 4 - with no rest in between.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite all these challenges, I graduated high school with an A- in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE). Each obstacle seemed insurmountable at the time, but somehow, we found a way through.
                </p>

                <h2>Joy in Simple Things</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this journey, soccer became more than just a game for me - it was therapy, community, and hope. On the dusty fields of Kakuma, kicking a ball with friends provided moments of pure joy amidst the challenges.
                </p>

                <div class="blog-image-section">
                    <img src="../assets/soccer.png" alt="Playing Soccer" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block; border-radius: 12px; transform: rotate(90deg);">
                </div>

                <p>
                    Soccer taught me teamwork, perseverance, and that beauty can be created even with limited resources. Some of my most cherished memories are of those evening games after completing school and church duties. These moments reminded me that even in difficult circumstances, there is still room for laughter, friendship, and dreams.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h2>A New Beginning</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, as I continue my studies in Computer Science at McGill University, I'm experiencing something I've never felt before - the freedom of simply being a person like everyone else. This resettlement in Canada represents more than just a new chapter; it's a new beginning. I carry with me the lessons learned in Kakuma, the discipline developed through morning chores, and the faith that has never failed me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I want to acknowledge that this reflection barely scratches the surface of a much larger story. So many people contributed to my journey - people whose love transcended borders and backgrounds. Their stories deserve to be told in full, and I hope to honor them properly in the future.
                </p>

                <h2>Lessons and Looking Forward</h2>
                <p>
                    From that 11-year-old boy watching the sunset with a heavy heart, to becoming a Computer Science student at one of Canada's most prestigious universities - this transformation shows what's possible when faith, perseverance, and community support come together. Here are some key lessons I've learned:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faith sustains:</strong> Even in the darkest moments, holding onto hope makes all the difference</li>
                    <li><strong>Service shapes character:</strong> Those early morning chores and church duties built discipline and humility</li>
                    <li><strong>Education is transformative:</strong> Despite every obstacle, academic excellence opened doors</li>
                    <li><strong>Community matters:</strong> People like Eunice, Joseph, and Pastor Martin were angels on my journey</li>
                    <li><strong>Resilience pays:</strong> Every setback became a setup for a comeback</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple joys matter:</strong> Soccer and small moments of happiness carried me through difficult times</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    My goal extends beyond personal success - I want to use my skills and story to make a positive impact on others. Whether through developing technology that helps people, mentoring other refugee students, or simply sharing reflections like this, I want to be a light in someone else's darkness, just as others were for me.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Life has been incredibly good to me. From Kakuma to McGill - this is what's possible with hope and determination."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    To everyone reading this reflection: no matter where you are or what you're facing, hold onto hope. Your current chapter is not your final story. My story isn't over either - I'm just beginning this new chapter as someone who finally feels at home in the world. Life has a strange sense of humor - a true comedian. It has a way of turning your struggles into your strengths, your tests into your testimony.

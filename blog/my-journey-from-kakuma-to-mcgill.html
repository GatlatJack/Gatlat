                <p>
                    Today marks a special day in my life - not just because I'm sharing my story, but because it's a reminder of the power of faith and hope through every season. Eleven years ago, on a day like this, I found the strength to guide me through this dark world. I knew I would not drown.
                </p>

                <div class="blog-image-section">
                    <img src="../assets/story1.png" alt="Early Journey" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block; border-radius: 12px;">
                </div>

                <h2>The Dark Valley</h2>
                <p>
                    In December of that year, I had to say goodbye to my spiritual father and pastor, Pastor Martin. My country was engulfed in flames due to civil war. I didn't know where my mother was. I was the eldest of my two sisters - the only siblings I was with at that time. So many thoughts were racing through my mind that an 11-year-old could not handle. But my faith became my anchor and ultimate hope.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inside the back of the pickup truck as we approached Kakuma Refugee Camp, I could see the sunset - red-brown and beautiful - but my heart was heavy. Too heavy for a child. That evening, I wept bitterly in so much pain, and I told the Lord: "Wherever I shall be, God let me find you."
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Wherever I shall be, God let me find you." - My prayer as an 11-year-old boy entering Kakuma Refugee Camp
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Finding Light in the Darkness</h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to Eunice Mosonik and Joseph Oluyundi, I was admitted to Ngundeng Primary School. I had no uniform. Thankfully, I found an old, used one in the corner of the church while I was sweeping - cleaning had become both a part of me and a habit of mine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My daily routine began at 5 AM as I walked to school, returning in the evening to attend fellowship in church and water the trees in the church compound. I would use a wheelbarrow to fetch 4 to 5 twenty-liter containers of water. These small acts of service became the foundation of my character.
                </p>

                <h2>Academic Excellence Against All Odds</h2>
                <p>
                    Four years later, I took my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams and earned a scholarship from Windle Trust, Kenya (which later became Windle International Kenya) after scoring 408 out of a possible 500 marks. I ranked as the second-best student in mathematics in the entire country.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I joined Butula Boys High School and excelled until I became severely concerned when I discovered I had an epididymal cyst. In 2020, I had to leave school early to undergo surgery. In the camp, surgeons only visit at specific times of the year, so all those needing surgery must wait for that window - if they miss it, they might have to wait until the following year, creating a lengthy cycle of uncertainty.
                </p>

                <h2>Overcoming Health Challenges and COVID-19</h2>
                <p>
                    I fell behind in my studies and struggled through Form Three. Although I had been a promising A-grade student, there simply wasn't enough time for me to catch up. That year, COVID-19 struck, and we were kept out of school for an extended period. Remarkably, as part of the KCSE 2022 cohort, we had to complete 4 terms in one year - the third term of Form 3 and all 3 terms of Form 4 - with no rest in between.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite all these challenges, I graduated high school with an A- in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE).
                </p>

                <h2>My Passion: Soccer</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this journey, soccer became more than just a game for me - it was therapy, community, and hope. On the dusty fields of Kakuma, kicking a ball with friends provided moments of pure joy amidst the challenges.
                </p>

                <div class="blog-image-section">
                    <img src="../assets/soccer.png" alt="Playing Soccer" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block; border-radius: 12px; transform: rotate(90deg);">
                </div>

                <p>
                    Soccer taught me teamwork, perseverance, and that beauty can be created even with limited resources. Some of my most cherished memories are of those evening games after completing school and church duties.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h2>McGill University: A New Chapter</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, as I continue my journey at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, I want to share the gratitude I feel for everyone who helped me along the way. Life has been incredibly good to me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From that 11-year-old boy watching the sunset from the back of a pickup truck with a heavy heart, to becoming a Computer Science student at one of Canada's most prestigious universities - this transformation shows what's possible. This is what faith, perseverance, and community support can achieve.
                </p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>Here are some key lessons from my journey:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faith sustains:</strong> Even in the darkest moments, holding onto hope makes all the difference</li>
                    <li><strong>Service shapes character:</strong> Those early morning chores and church duties built discipline and humility</li>
                    <li><strong>Education is transformative:</strong> Despite every obstacle, academic excellence opened doors</li>
                    <li><strong>Community matters:</strong> People like Eunice, Joseph, and Pastor Martin were angels on my journey</li>
                    <li><strong>Resilience pays:</strong> Every setback became a setup for a comeback</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple joys matter:</strong> Soccer and small moments of happiness carried me through difficult times</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                <p>
                    As I continue my studies in Computer Science, I carry with me the lessons learned in Kakuma, the discipline developed through morning chores, and the faith that has never failed me. My goal extends beyond personal success - I want to use my skills and story to make a positive impact on others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether through developing technology that helps people, mentoring other refugee students, or simply sharing this story, I want to be a light in someone else's darkness, just as others were for me.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Life has been incredibly good to me. From Kakuma to McGill - this is what's possible with hope and determination."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    To everyone reading this: no matter where you are or what you're facing, hold onto hope. Your current chapter is not your final story. Life has a strange sense of humor - a true comedian. It has a way of turning your struggles into your strengths, your tests into your testimony.

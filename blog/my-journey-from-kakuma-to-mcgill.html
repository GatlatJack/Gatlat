                    As a Computer Science student at McGill University, I often reflect on the educational milestones that brought me to one of Canada's most prestigious institutions. This post highlights the academic achievements and professional development experiences that have shaped my career path.
                </p>

                <h2>Academic Foundation and Excellence</h2>
                <p>
                    My academic journey began with strong performance in primary education, culminating in exceptional results on the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams. Scoring 408 out of 500 marks, I ranked as the second-best student in mathematics nationwide - a achievement that opened doors to advanced educational opportunities through scholarship programs.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h2>Secondary Education and Resilience</h2>
                <p>
                    At Butula Boys High School, I continued to excel academically while developing crucial life skills including discipline, time management, and perseverance. Despite facing health challenges in 2020 that required medical attention and caused temporary academic disruption, I maintained focus on my educational goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The COVID-19 pandemic presented additional challenges, requiring completion of 4 academic terms in one year as part of the KCSE 2022 cohort. Through strategic time management and dedicated study habits, I successfully graduated with an A- in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), demonstrating adaptability under pressure.
                </p>

                <h2>Professional Skills Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout my academic journey, I developed valuable professional competencies including:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem-solving abilities:</strong> Demonstrated through consistently high mathematics performance</li>

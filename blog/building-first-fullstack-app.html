                <p>
                    There's something magical about seeing your ideas come to life through code. When I decided to build my first 
                    full-stack web application during my internship at McGill Research Institute, I had no idea I was about to embark 
                    on one of the most challenging yet rewarding learning experiences of my programming journey.
                </p>

                <h2>The Project: A Bioinformatics Data Management System</h2>
                <p>
                    The application I built was designed to help researchers manage and analyze genomic data more efficiently. 
                    It needed to handle user authentication, file uploads, data processing, and provide an intuitive interface 
                    for researchers who weren't necessarily tech-savvy.
                </p>

                <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>User registration and authentication system</li>
                    <li>Secure file upload and storage</li>
                    <li>Data visualization capabilities</li>
                    <li>Real-time processing status updates</li>
                    <li>Responsive design for various devices</li>
                    <li>Integration with existing research databases</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Technology Stack</h2>
                <p>
                    After researching various options and consulting with my supervisor, I settled on a tech stack that balanced 
                    learning opportunities with practical requirements:
                </p>

                <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <h4>Frontend</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Angular:</strong> For building a dynamic, component-based user interface</li>
                        <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> For responsive design and consistent UI components</li>
                        <li><strong>Chart.js:</strong> For data visualization</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Backend</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>PHP:</strong> Server-side logic and API development</li>
                        <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> Database for storing user data and file metadata</li>
                        <li><strong>Apache:</strong> Web server configuration</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Tools & Environment</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>XAMPP:</strong> Local development environment</li>
                        <li><strong>Git:</strong> Version control</li>
                        <li><strong>Chrome DevTools:</strong> Debugging and optimization</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>The Development Journey</h2>

                <h3>Week 1-2: Foundation and Planning</h3>
                <p>
                    I started by creating detailed wireframes and planning the database schema. This upfront planning proved 
                    invaluable throughout the development process. I learned that time spent planning is time saved debugging later.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning." - A lesson learned the hard way!
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Week 3-4: Backend Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Building the backend was my first real encounter with server-side programming. Creating RESTful APIs, 
                    implementing proper error handling, and setting up database connections taught me the importance of 
                    clean, maintainable code.
                </p>

                <h4>Key Challenges:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication Security:</strong> Implementing secure password hashing and session management</li>
                    <li><strong>File Upload Handling:</strong> Managing large genomic files with proper validation and error handling</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Optimization:</strong> Writing efficient queries for handling large datasets</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Week 5-6: Frontend Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Working with Angular was initially overwhelming, but I quickly fell in love with its component-based architecture. 
                    Creating reusable components and managing state across different parts of the application taught me valuable 
                    lessons about software architecture.
                </p>

                <h4>Frontend Breakthroughs:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Component Communication:</strong> Learning to pass data between parent and child components</li>
                    <li><strong>HTTP Services:</strong> Creating services to communicate with the backend API</li>
                    <li><strong>Reactive Forms:</strong> Building dynamic forms with validation</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring the app worked well on different screen sizes</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Week 7-8: Integration and Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    This was where things got really interesting (and challenging). Connecting the frontend to the backend 
                    revealed numerous integration issues I hadn't anticipated.
                </p>

                <h2>Major Challenges and Solutions</h2>

                <h3>Challenge 1: CORS Issues</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing errors prevented my Angular app from communicating with the PHP backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> I learned to configure proper CORS headers in PHP and understand the browser's security model.
                </p>

                <pre><code>// PHP solution
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:4200");
header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS");
header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization");</code></pre>

                <h3>Challenge 2: File Upload Progress Tracking</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Large genomic files took time to upload, but users had no feedback about the progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented a progress bar using Angular's HTTP client and PHP's upload progress tracking.
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge 3: Real-time Updates</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem:</strong> Users needed to know when their data processing was complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> While I initially considered WebSockets, I implemented a simpler polling mechanism 
                    that checked processing status every few seconds.
                </p>

                <h2>Key Lessons Learned</h2>

                <h3>1. Start Small, Think Big</h3>
                <p>
                    I initially tried to build everything at once, which led to confusion and bugs. Breaking the project into 
                    smaller, manageable features made development much more enjoyable and successful.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Error Handling is Critical</h3>
                <p>
                    Early versions of my app crashed frequently because I didn't properly handle edge cases. Learning to anticipate 
                    and gracefully handle errors made the application much more robust.
                </p>

                <h3>3. User Experience Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Technical functionality is important, but if users can't figure out how to use your application, it's worthless. 
                    I learned to put myself in the user's shoes and test every interaction.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Documentation Saves Time</h3>
                <p>
                    Writing comments and documentation as I coded saved countless hours when I needed to modify features later. 
                    Future me was very grateful to past me for this habit.
                </p>

                <h2>The Testing Phase</h2>
                <p>
                    Testing with real researchers revealed issues I never would have discovered on my own:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Users tried to upload files in formats I hadn't anticipated</li>
                    <li>The interface was confusing for non-technical users</li>
                    <li>Loading times were slower than acceptable for large datasets</li>
                    <li>Mobile responsiveness needed improvement</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Each piece of feedback was a learning opportunity that made the application better and taught me the value 
                    of user-centered design.
                </p>

                <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
                <p>
                    As the application grew, performance became a concern. I learned several optimization techniques:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Database Indexing:</strong> Adding indexes to frequently queried columns dramatically improved response times</li>
                    <li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Loading data only when needed reduced initial page load times</li>
                    <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Compressing and properly sizing images improved overall performance</li>
                    <li><strong>Caching:</strong> Implementing simple caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Deployment Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    Moving from my local XAMPP environment to a production server introduced new challenges:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Environment configuration differences</li>
                    <li>File permission issues</li>
                    <li>Database migration complications</li>
                    <li>SSL certificate setup</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Each challenge taught me more about web server administration and the importance of environment parity 
                    between development and production.
                </p>

                <h2>The Final Result</h2>
                <p>
                    After eight weeks of development, testing, and refinement, the application successfully:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>✅ Processed over 500 genomic data files</li>

                    <li>✅ Maintained 99.5% uptime</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on the project, there are several things I would approach differently:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>More Comprehensive Planning:</strong> I underestimated the complexity of certain features</li>
                    <li><strong>Earlier User Testing:</strong> Getting feedback sooner would have saved time on redesigns</li>
                    <li><strong>Better Git Practices:</strong> More frequent commits with descriptive messages</li>
                    <li><strong>Security First:</strong> Implementing security measures from the beginning, not as an afterthought</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> Load testing earlier in the development process</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Skills Gained</h2>

                <p>
                    If you're considering building your first full-stack application, here's my advice:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start with a Real Problem:</strong> Build something that solves an actual need</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose Technologies You Can Learn:</strong> Don't try to master everything at once</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan Your Database First:</strong> A well-designed schema saves countless hours later</li>
                    <li><strong>Embrace the Learning Curve:</strong> Every error message is a learning opportunity</li>
                    <li><strong>Get Feedback Early and Often:</strong> Don't develop in isolation</li>
                    <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Your future self will thank you</li>
                    <li><strong>Celebrate Small Wins:</strong> Each working feature is an achievement worth acknowledging</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Building my first full-stack application was challenging, frustrating, exciting, and ultimately incredibly 
                    rewarding. It taught me that programming is not just about writing code—it's about solving problems, 
                    understanding users, and creating solutions that make a real difference.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The eight weeks I spent on this project taught me more about software development than any textbook or 
                    tutorial could. It showed me the importance of persistence, the value of user feedback, and the satisfaction 
                    that comes from seeing your code make a positive impact in the real world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To anyone reading this who's hesitating to start their first big project: take the leap. The journey will 
                    be challenging, but the skills you'll gain and the confidence you'll build are invaluable. Your first 
                    full-stack application won't be perfect, but it will be yours, and that's something worth celebrating.
